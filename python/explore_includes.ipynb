SINCE THERE ARE IMPERFECT CREDIT MARKETS AND OTHER LIMITING ASPECTS, THE MARKET IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE EDUCATION IN THE AMOUNTS THAT SOCIETY DESIRES AND, THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO AFFORD PRIVATE EDUCATION. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS A CLEAR DISPARITY IN TERMS OF QUALITY BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EDUCATION. THE PRIVATE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSEDLY ABLE TO REGULATE ITSELF THROUGH COMPETITION, WHILE PUBLIC EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE REGULATED BY THE STATE IN ORDER TO ASSURE MINIMUM QUALITY LEVELS. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE OF CEARA (BRAZIL), TWO PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL REGULATORY SYSTEMS ARE COMPARED: A PUBLIC VOUCHER SYSTEM AND A SYSTEM BASED ON TEACHER INCENTIVES. IN THE VOUCHER SYSTEM, COMPETITION WOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO INCREASE THEIR LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY, BUT IT MAY ORIGINATE SOME \"CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE\", PENALIZING THE LEAST EFFICIENT SCHOOLS, AND WEAK INCENTIVES TO TEACHERS MAY UNDERMINE ITS EXPECTED RESULTS. THE SYSTEM BASED ON TEACHER INCENTIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A FORM OF \"POSITIVE REGULATION\" IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WILL BE NO SANCTIONS TO THE WORST SCHOOLS. THE IDEA IS TO REWARD, THROUGH PECUNIARY BENEFITS, TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS OF THOSE SCHOOLS CONSIDERED THE BEST IN TERMS OF EXISTING LEVELS AND/OR IN TERMS OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION PROVIDED. THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT A SYSTEM, SUCH AS THE LATTER MAY INDUCE A HEALTHY COMPETITION AMONG PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT WOULD END UP IMPROVING TEACHING QUALITY AND ACHIEVEMENT.',\n",

GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS PERFORMANCE WE DECIDED TO ANALYZE THE COMPARATIVE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS USING A METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED BY THANASSOULIS (1999) AND FURTHER EXTENDED BY PORTELA AND THANASSOULIS (2001). THE FORMER DECOMPOSES EFFICIENCY INTO TWO COMPONENTS: ONE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SCHOOL AND THE OTHER EXCLUSIVELY TO THE STUDENT. RESULTS SHOW LARGE DIFFERENCES IN EFFICIENCY BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. PRIVATE SCHOOLS OBTAINED MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY SCORE WHILE PUBLIC ONES REACHED ONLY 0.901. MOREOVER, FEDERAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS REACHED A SCORE OF 0.910 AND STATE SCHOOLS 0.879. SCHOOLS WERE FURTHER ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUITY PERFORMANCE CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE OBTAINED BY EACH STUDENT.

WHEREAS ECONOMISTS SINCE MILTON FRIEDMAN HAVE ARGUED THAT SCHOOL CHOICE WOULD ALIGN PROVIDER INCENTIVES WITH THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND THUS LEAD TO INCREASES IN EDUCATIONAL QUALITY, A MORE RECENT LITERATURE POINTS TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SCHOOL CHOICE MIGHT EXACERBATE STRATIFICATION BY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ACROSS SCHOOLS. IN \"SCHOOL CHOICE, STRATIFICATION, AND INFORMATION ON SCHOOL PERFORMANCE: LESSONS FROM CHILE,\" PATRICK J. MCEWAN, MIGUEL URQUIOLA, AND EMILIANA VEGAS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS LITERATURE IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, USING HIGHLY DISAGGREGATED, DISTRICT-LEVEL DATA FOR CHILE AND A REGRESSION-DISCONTINUITY DESIGN, THEY FIND EVIDENCE THAT THE ENTRY OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS INTO THE EDUCATION MARKET IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN TEST SCORES BUT IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION. THIS CONCLUSION IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS FROM THE LITERATURE, SUGGESTING THAT GREATER SCHOOL CHOICE LEADS TO INCREASED SORTING, WITH NO COMMENSURATE IMPROVEMENTS IN AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT. SECOND, MCEWAN, URQUIOLA, AND VEGAS CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF SAMPLING VARIANCE (AND EVEN OF \"POPULATION VARIANCE\" OVER TIME) FOR POLICY SCHEMES THAT REWARD OR PUNISH SCHOOLS ON THE BASIS OF CHANGES IN AVERAGE TEST SCORES. POLICYMAKERS HAVE FOCUSED ON THESE SO-CALLED VALUE ADDED (THAT IS, FIRST-DIFFERENCED) MEASURES OF TEST SCORES, SINCE TEST SCORE LEVELS ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AS A RESULT OF THE STRATIFICATION PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. CHANGES IN SCORES ALSO REFLECT SAMPLING VARIATION, HOWEVER, INCLUDING VARIATION AMONG THE SPECIFIC GROUPS OF STUDENTS STARTING SCHOOL IN ANY GIVEN YEAR, AS WELL AS GENUINE CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOLS. ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE IS UNLIKELY TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR LARGE MUNICIPALITIES, IT CAN GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL RERANKINGS FOR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS AND EVEN FOR SMALLER DISTRICTS, AS THE AUTHORS CONFIRM THROUGH A NUMBER OF STATISTICAL TESTS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE CHILEAN DEBATES ON SCHOOL CHOICE, ON THE IDEAL DESIGN FOR VOUCHER SCHEMES, AND ON THE PRECISE MANNER IN WHICH DATA ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT CAN BE USED TO REWARD OR PUNISH SCHOOLS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ADVANCES IN THE EDUCATIONAL AGENDA IN LATIN AMERICA BUT HAVE NOT YET REACHED A FINAL CONCLUSION.',\n",

WHILE INPUT/OUTPUT MODELS PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY, THEY DO NOT OFFER INSIGHT INTO WHAT ACTUALLY TRANSPIRES INSIDE OF A CLASSROOM (O'SULLIVAN, 2006). MUCH DEPENDS ON EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND USE OF THESE VERY RESOURCES. THOUGH SYSTEMIC ISSUES IN THE NICARAGUAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM PRODUCED NUMEROUS OBSTACLES FOR THE ELEVEN PARTICIPATING 3RD AND 6TH GRADE TEACHERS, THE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION MODEL SUPPORTED TEACHERS' ABILITY TO BE INNOVATIVE AND GROW THEIR PRACTICE IN FOUR WAYS: A) INCREASED PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE; B) OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AS A COMMUNITY OF TEACHERS; C) FLEXIBILITY IN ADAPTATION OF THE INTERVENTION MODEL TO THEIR SPECIFIC CLASSROOM CONTEXT; AND D) USE OF VIDEOS AS SUPPORTIVE RESOURCES FOR CONTENT KNOWLEDGE.\",\n",

THE PAPER EMPLOYS THE AUTOETHNOGRAPHICAL METHOD (AUTO/ETHNO/GRAPHY), WHICH IS A STUDY OF SELF IN CONTEXT. USING THE TOOL OF MEMORY, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL INVESTIGATION OF ONE SET OF MIGRANT EXPERIENCES CONFIRMS THE COMMONALITY OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS AND UNDERSCORES THE EFFICIENCY OF COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION IN MANAGING THE SAME LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES IN TWO SETTINGS. THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT OF SCHOOLING IN ENGLAND REVEALED THE IMPACT AND INFLUENCE OF FAMILY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE RACIST PRACTICES THAT EVENTUALLY BECAME ENTRENCHED. HOWEVER, THE ACCOUNT ALSO REVEALED THE UNPLANNED AND CASUAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT DID ARISE FOR A CHILD TO NAVIGATE HER WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AS THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES HARDENED WITH TIME AND LEGISLATION, THERE WAS INCREASED ALIENATION AND THE SEARCH BY YOUNGER MIGRANTS FOR A BETTER WAY OF BELONGING THROUGH 'HOME' AND COMMUNITY. THE PAPER OBLIQUELY SEARCHES FOR THE COMMON GROUNDS AND ROUTES SHARED BY LATER MIGRANTS AND DESCENDANTS OF MIGRANTS.

A SECOND QUESTION ADDRESSED IN THIS RESEARCH IS WHETHER A PARTICULAR INTERVENTION IS EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN POOR AND NONPOOR ENVIRONMENTS. A THIRD IMPORTANT CONCERN ADDRESSED HERE IS WHETHER THESE COMPENSATORY INTERVENTIONS WERE, IN FACT, TARGETED TOWARD THOSE CHILDREN MOST IN NEED OF THEM. TO ADDRESS THESE THREE ISSUES, DATA WERE GATHERED FROM CHILDREN'S PARENTS, TEACHERS, AND SCHOOLS IN FOUR LARGE LATIN AMERICAN CITIES: GREATER BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA; BELO HORIZONTE AND MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL; SANTIAGO, CHILE; AND LEON, GUANAJUATO, MEXICO. THESE CITIES WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE EACH HAS DEVELOPED DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY, EFFICIENCY, AND EQUITY OF THEIR PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS. IN SUMMARY, THIS RESEARCH FINDS THAT NOT ALL INTERVENTIONS ARE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE. THE INTERVENTIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS INCLUDE CLASSROOM LIBRARIES, TEXTBOOK DISTRIBUTION, AND IN-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING. ABOVE ALL, CLASSROOM LIBRARIES ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO LANGUAGE AND MATH ACHIEVEMENT, AND TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF PROMOTION IN THE TOTAL SAMPLE AND IN BOTH SUBSAMPLES. CONSISTENT WITH MANY PREVIOUS STUDIES, TEXTBOOK DISTRIBUTION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES ACHIEVEMENT IN BOTH LANGUAGE AND MATH FOR THE TOTAL SAMPLE. IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF PROMOTION IN THE NONPOOR SUBSAMPLE, AND IT DECREASES THE LEARNING GAP BETWEEN THE HIGHER AND LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS FOR CHILDREN IN THE POOR SUBSAMPLE. IN-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMS APPEAR TO BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR INCREASING ACHIEVEMENT AND PROMOTION IN POOR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS. THEY EFFECTIVELY INCREASE THE ABILITY OF TEACHERS TO EDUCATE POORLY PERFORMING STUDENTS. (CONTAINS 57 NOTES.)\",\n",

FOR CONGLOMERATE MERGERS, WE ESTIMATED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FRESHMEN AND TUITION FEES, WHEREAS FOR ACQUISITIONS THAT LEAD TO HORIZONTAL CONCENTRATION THERE IS NO INCREASE IN QUANTITY, JUST IN PRICES. ALSO THESE EFFECTS ARE LARGER THE SMALLER THE MARKET SHARE OF THE ACQUIRED HEI. ON THE WHOLE, OUR FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MULTIUNIT OPERATIONS INCREASE EFFICIENCY, BUT ONLY CONGLOMERATE MERGERS TEND TO PASS THOSE GAINS ON TO CONSUMERS.

THE EQUATION USED IN THE RESEARCH ALLOWS TO INDICATE THAT INDEXES OBTAINED FROM ZERO SUGGEST MAXIMUM INEFFICIENCY IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND ONE INDICATOR SUGGESTS MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT. THE EQUATION HAS THE VARIABLES PI = SCORE ASSIGNED TO THE VARIABLE I; N = TOTAL NUMBER OF I VARIABLES. WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS NO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT THAT INDICATES EFFICIENCY IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT. THE INDICES OF THE VARIABLES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE EXISTENCE OF A PROFESSIONAL THAT EVALUATES ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, THE FORMATION OF SERVERS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, THE ELABORATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT REPORTS, THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS ON THE CAMPUSES, AND THE USE OF SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT ARE PERCENTAGE INDICES WHICH INDICATE THE INEFFICIENCY IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CARRIED OUT IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL EXTENSION.',\n",

METHOD: THIS WAS A QUALITATIVE STUDY BASED ON THE SOCIAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF ALFRED SCHUTZ. DATA WAS COLLECTED BETWEEN JANUARY AND APRIL 2013, THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH 13 PRIMARY HEALTH CARE NURSES IN CHILE. RESULTS: THE NURSES PERCEIVED PRIMARY CARE AS A GRATIFYING EXPERIENCE, CONSIDERING IT AN ENCOUNTER OF SUBJECTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THEY FELT BURDENED WITH MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS AND BY THE HIERARCHICAL PRESSURE TO ACHIEVE TARGETS. THEY STRIVED TO IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE CARE, EXPRESSED BY THE DESIRE TO GO BEYOND TRADITIONAL CARE PRACTICES, AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF MANAGEMENT AT THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE. CONCLUSION: IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY IN THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH CARE AND ESPECIALLY NURSING EDUCATION, WITH THE GOAL OF BETTER PREPARING NURSES WHO WILL DELIVER CARE AT THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE LEVEL.',\n",

BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW, THE PAPER IDENTIFIES THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY AS INNOVATION, EDUCATION, MARKET EFFICIENCY, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INSTITUTIONS. BASED ON UNDERLYING PROXIES, THE PAPER CONSTRUCTS INDEXES REPRESENTING EACH OF THE MAIN CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTIVITY DETERMINANTS AND, COMBINING THEM THROUGH PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS, OBTAINS AN OVERALL DETERMINANT INDEX. THIS IS DONE FOR EVERY YEAR IN THE THREE DECADES SPANNING 1985-2015 AND FOR MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES. IN PARALLEL, THE PAPER PRESENTS A MEASURE OF TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY (TFP), LARGELY OBTAINED FROM THE PENN WORLD TABLE, AND ASSESSES THE PATTERN OF PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH ACROSS REGIONS AND INCOME GROUPS OVER THE SAME SAMPLE. THE PAPER THEN EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MEASURES OF TFP AND ITS DETERMINANTS. THE VARIANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IS DECOMPOSED INTO THE SHARE EXPLAINED BY EACH OF ITS MAIN DETERMINANTS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND THE OVERALL DETERMINANT INDEX IS IDENTIFIED. THE VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE HIGHEST CONTRIBUTOR AMONG THE DETERMINANTS TO THE VARIANCE IN TFP GROWTH IS MARKET EFFICIENCY FOR ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT COUNTRIES AND EDUCATION FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN THE MOST RECENT DECADE. THE REGRESSION RESULTS INDICATE THAT, CONTROLLING FOR COUNTRY- AND TIME-SPECIFIC EFFECTS, TFP GROWTH HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROPOSED TFP DETERMINANT INDEX AND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH INITIAL TFP. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS THEN USED TO PROVIDE A SET OF SIMULATIONS ON THE POTENTIAL PATH OF TFP GROWTH IF CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS ON TFP DETERMINANTS ARE ACHIEVED. THE PAPER PRESENTS AND DISCUSSES SOME OF THESE SIMULATIONS FOR GROUPS OF COUNTRIES BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND INCOME LEVEL. IN ADDITION, AS A COUNTRY-SPECIFIC ILLUSTRATION, THE PAPER PRESENTS SIMULATIONS ON THE POTENTIAL PATH OF TFP GROWTH FOR PERU UNDER VARIOUS SCENARIOS. AN ACCOMPANYING EXCELBASED TOOLKIT, LINKED TO THE LTGM, PROVIDES A LARGER SET OF SIMULATIONS AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL FOR THE NEXT FEW DECADES.\",\n",

THE RHETORIC AROUND CHARTER SCHOOLS IN GENERAL PUTS LITTLE ATTENTION ON TEACHER MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCE ACQUISITION, AND THE LITERATURE ON CHARTER SCHOOLS HAS TENDED TO FOCUS ON OUTCOMES SUCH AS STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. THE PREVALENCE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ROLE SUCH ISSUES AS TEACHER MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCING PLAY IN THIS INCREASINGLY POPULAR EDUCATION REFORM. FOCUS OF STUDY: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO UNCOVER AND PRESENT THE STRATEGIES THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS EMPLOY FOR MANAGING TEACHERS AND ACQUIRING RESOURCES, AND WITH WHAT IMPLICATIONS. RESEARCH DESIGN: THROUGH A QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY OF A CHARTER SCHOOL PROGRAM IN BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, THAT BEGAN IN 1999, WE INVESTIGATED (A) THE REGULATIONS THAT GOVERNED THE HIRING FIRING. AND COMPENSATION OF CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS,, IN ADDITION TO (B) HOW CHARTERS RESPOND TO THOSE REGULATIONS IN CONTRACTING TEACHERS, AND (C) THE OVERALL APPROACH OF CHARTER PRINCIPALS AND THE CHARTER MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS (CMOS) THAT OVERSEE THEM WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHER ENGAGEMENT. COLLABORATION, SUPERVISION, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IN TERMS OF RESOURCE ACQUISITION, THE FOCUS WAS ON UNDERSTANDING (D) THE EXTENT OF GOVERNMENT PROVIDED RESOURCES TO CHARTER SCHOOLS, (E) THE PERCEPTIONS OF CHARTER PRINCIPALS AND CMO DIRECTORS OF THE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT. (F) THE WAYS IN WHICH THESE ACTORS HAVE SOUGHT TO COMPLEMENT THESE RESOURCES, AND (G) THE KINDS OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED. DATA IN THE FORM OF DOCUMENTS, ARCHIVES, LITERATURE AND EVALUATIONS, AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE COLLECTED OVER EIGHT MONTHS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS IN BOGOTA FEEL THAT MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR WORK ENVIRONMENT ARE POSITIVE, THOUGH THEY ALSO REPORT TRADEOFFS IN TERMS OF JOB SECURITY AND FINANCIAL COMPENSATION. CHARTER SCHOOLS USE THE FLEXIBILITY AFFORDED TO THEM AROUND EMPLOYMENT TO SPEND HALF AS MUCH ON TEACHERS BY HIRING NONUNIONIZED TEACHERS, CONTRACTING THEM FOR PERIODS OF A YEAR OR LESS, ASSIGNING TEACHERS TO LOWER COMPENSATION CATEGORIES, AND OFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SALARIES, DESPITE TEACHERS WORKING OVER 12 HOURS MORE EACH WEEK THAN THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOL COUNTERPARTS. FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO RESOURCE ACQUISITION ADDRESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUBLIC AND CHARTER SCHOOLS, PERCEPTIONS OF SCHOOL LEADERS, AND THE ROUTES TO RESOURCE ACQUISITION USED BY CHARTER SCHOOLS, NAMELY BUDGET PRIORITIZATION, DONATIONS, VOLUNTEERS, PARTNERSHIPS, AND ALUMNI NETWORKS. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE DISCUSSED, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR STUDIES TO DISTINGUISH AMONG TYPES OF CHARTER SCHOOLS.

THE METHODOLOGY USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE APPLICATION WAS BASED ON AN INTERACTIVE CHILDREN'S BOOK FLUX DESIGN. THE APPLICATION WAS ELABORATED FOR THE ANDROID AND IOS PLATFORMS. TO EVALUATE USABILITY, A TEST METHOD COMPOSED OF OBSERVATION AND INTERVIEW SURVEYING WAS USED, AND THE MEASURING MECHANISM CONSISTED OF THE USER'S SUCCESS RATE. THE SAMPLE (N=43) WAS RANDOMLY COMPOSED OF PRESCHOOL STUDENTS (3-5 YEARS OF AGE) FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN BRAZIL.RESULTS:IN THE EFFECTIVENESS TESTS, THE SUCCESS RATES OF THE STORY AND GAME MENUS WERE 97.6% AND 85.3%, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE EFFICIENCY TESTS, THE RESPECTIVE RATES WERE 80.2% AND 82.1%. THE SATISFACTION EVALUATION RATE WAS 99.7%.DISCUSSION:THE GAME PUT THE HEALTHY FOOD INTO THE MOUTH SHOWED TO BE DIFFICULT IN UTILIZATION DUE TO THE CHILDREN'S LACK OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING HEALTHY FOODS (P &lt; 0.001 AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL). THREE YEAR OLDS DEMONSTRATED A GREATER REQUIREMENT FOR ASSISTANCE DURING NAVIGATION.CONCLUSIONS:THE APPLICATION WAS SUCCESSFUL REGARDING THE FOLLOWING THREE ASSESSED ATTRIBUTES: (1) EFFECTIVENESS, (2) EFFICIENCY, AND (3) SATISFACTION. HOWEVER, DIETARY EDUCATION WAS OBSERVED TO BE NECESSARY FOR THE CHILDREN AND THEIR GUARDIANS.\",\n",

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PAPER ARE TO DESCRIBE AN INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE TO EXPAND INTERPROFESSIONAL AND GLOBAL PHARMACY EDUCATION AND TO EVALUATE THE ROLES AND IMPACT OF FOURTH-YEAR PHARMACY STUDENTS AND A PHARMACIST INTEGRATED INTO AN INTERPROFESSIONAL TEAM ON A MEDICAL BRIGADE TO GUATEMALA. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: IN AUGUST 2014, TWO FOURTH-YEAR STUDENT PHARMACISTS AND ONE PHARMACIST/PROFESSOR JOINED A GROUP OF 26 PRE-MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM BOSTON COLLEGE ( BC), SIX MEDICAL DOCTORS AND A NURSING ASSISTANT AS PART OF A ONE-WEEK MEDICAL BRIGADE TO QUETZALTENANGO, GUATEMALA. AN ELECTRONIC SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED TO ALL BRIGADE MEMBERS UPON COMPLETION OF TRAVEL. THE SURVEY ASSESSED THE MOST USEFUL SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE PHARMACIST AND PHARMACY STUDENTS ON THE BRIGADE AND CHANGES IN PERSPECTIVE TOWARDS THE ROLE OF PHARMACY ON AN INTERPROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARE TEAM. THE SURVEY ALSO COLLECTED INFORMATION DESCRIBING SATISFACTION WITH COMMUNICATION, EFFICIENCY, PROFESSIONALISM AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHARMACY STAFF. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: PHARMACY STAFF WAS UTILIZED FOR KNOWLEDGE OF DRUG PRODUCTS, THERAPEUTIC SUBSTITUTION, COUNSELING AND DRUG DOSING/CALCULATIONS. THE BRIGADE DIRECTLY RESULTED IN AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD FOR PHYSICIANS AND STUDENTS TO REFER A QUESTION TO A PHARMACIST. AFTER THIS BRIGADE, ALL NON-PHARMACY MEMBERS VIEWED PHARMACISTS AS IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL TEAM AND FELT BETTER PREPARED TO WORK AS PART OF A TEAM. SUMMARY: THE EXPERIENCE WAS EFFECTIVE IN FOSTERING INTERPROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONGST HEALTHCARE STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS.',\n",

THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALLOCATIONS ARE NOT MADE IN RESPONSE TO ENDOWMENT DIFFERENCES IN ISOLATION, BUT DEPEND ON THE INTERACTION OF CHILD ENDOWMENT, GENDER, AND BENEFICIARY STATUS. MOREOVER, INVESTMENTS ARE MADE SO AS TO COUNTERBALANCE EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS: WIDENING DIFFERENCES IN HEIGHT BUT CLOSING GAPS IN BMI, WHERE BOTH STRATEGIES MAXIMIZE RETURNS GIVEN THE EARNINGS-ENDOWMENT FUNCTION FOR HEIGHT AND BMI IN MEXICO. FINALLY, HOUSEHOLD SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS MATTERS. THUS, DISCRIMINATORY RESPONSES WITHIN THE BETTER-OFF URBAN BENEFICIARY HOUSEHOLDS ARE SMALLER. IN CONTRAST, INDIGENOUS BENEFICIARY HOUSEHOLDS, WHICH HAVE THE LOWEST AVERAGE ENDOWMENT Z-SCORES AND FRACTION SPENT ON EDUCATION, SEE THE LARGEST DIFFERENCES IN EDUCATIONAL OUTLAY BETWEEN CHILD SUBGROUPS. WHILE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS SEEM SMALL, THESE ARE MEASURED RELATIVE TO THE MEAN OF THE BASE CATEGORY. IN SOME CASES, THEN, PARENTS ARE DEDICATING NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL EXPENDITURES TO EDUCATION FOR A STANDARD DEVIATION INCREASE IN ENDOWMENT OVER MEAN SIBLING ENDOWMENT.

       "  \"BACKGROUND: USING STANDARD FISCAL INCIDENCE ANALYSIS AND THE NEW METHODOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS BY THE COMMITMENT TO EQUITY (CEQ) INSTITUTE, THIS PAPER ESTIMATES THE IMPACT OF FISCAL POLICY ON INEQUALITY AND POVERTY IN SIXTEEN COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AROUND 2010. METHODS: WITH INFORMATION ON INCOMES, CONSUMPTION, AND OTHER DIMENSIONS AVAILABLE IN HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS, AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM, THE CEQ METHOD CONSISTS IN ALLOCATING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL THE BURDEN OF PERSONAL INCOME AND CONSUMPTION TAXES, AND THE BENEFITS FROM CASH TRANSFERS, CONSUMPTION SUBSIDIES, AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON EDUCATION AND HEALTH. THIS PROCESS YIELDS THE PRE-FISCAL AND POST-FISCAL INCOME CONCEPTS OF INTEREST. THESE INCOME CONCEPTS, IN TURN, ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE CORRESPONDING INDICATORS OF INEQUALITY AND POVERTY. THUS, ONE CAN ESTIMATE, FOR EACH COUNTRY, THE IMPACT OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM AND EACH OF ITS COMPONENTS ON INEQUALITY AND POVERTY. SINCE THE METHODOLOGY THAT WAS APPLIED IS THE SAME, RESULTS ARE COMPARABLE ACROSS COUNTRIES. RESULTS: THE COUNTRIES THAT REDISTRIBUTE THE MOST ARE ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COSTA RICA, AND URUGUAY. GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, AND PERU ARE THE COUNTRIES THAT REDISTRIBUTE THE LEAST. FISCAL POLICY REDUCES EXTREME (INCOME) POVERTY IN TWELVE OUT OF THE SIXTEEN COUNTRIES. THE INCIDENCE OF POVERTY AFTER TAXES, SUBSIDIES, AND CASH TRANSFERS, HOWEVER, IS HIGHER THAN MARKET INCOME POVERTY IN BOLIVIA, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, AND NICARAGUA, EVEN THOUGH FISCAL POLICY REDUCES INEQUALITY IN THESE FOUR COUNTRIES. CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS HAVE A HETEROGENEOUS EFFECT ON INEQUALITY AND, CONTRARY TO SOME EXPECTATIONS, THEIR IMPACT IS EQUALIZING IN NINE OF THE COUNTRIES. IN THE SIXTEEN COUNTRIES, SPENDING ON PRE-SCHOOL AND PRIMARY EDUCATION IS EQUALIZING AND PRO-POOR (PER CAPITA BENEFITS DECLINE WITH INCOME PER CAPITA). SPENDING ON SECONDARY EDUCATION IS ALWAYS EQUALIZING; IT IS ALSO PRO POOR IN SOME OF THE COUNTRIES. SPENDING ON TERTIARY EDUCATION IS NEVER PRO-POOR BUT IT IS EQUALIZING IN ALL THE COUNTRIES EXCEPT FOR GUATEMALA. SPENDING ON HEALTH IS ALWAYS EQUALIZING BUT PRO-POOR ONLY IN SOME COUNTRIES. CONCLUSIONS: LATIN AMERICA PRESENTS A GREAT DEAL OF HETEROGENEITY IN THE SIZE OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO USE THEIR FISCAL POWER TO REDUCE INEQUALITY AND POVERTY. A HIGHER SHARE OF SOCIAL SPENDING (TO GDP) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGER REDISTRIBUTIVE EFFECT BUT COUNTRIES WITH SIMILAR, OR EVEN LOWER, SHARES OF SOCIAL SPENDING SHOW HETEROGENEOUS REDISTRIBUTIVE EFFECTS IMPLYING THAT OTHER FACTORS BEYOND SIZE SUCH AS THE COMPOSITION AND TARGETING OF SOCIAL SPENDING (AND TAXES) ARE AT PLAY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT A HIGHER REDISTRIBUTIVE EFFECT IS NOT NECESSARILY A DESIRABLE OUTCOME SINCE IN THIS ARTICLE THERE IS NO ESTIMATION OF THE IMPACT OF REDISTRIBUTIVE POLICY ON FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND EFFICIENCY. IN SOME COUNTRIES, THE BURDEN OF CONSUMPTION TAXES IS SUCH THAT A PORTION OF THE POOR ARE NET PAYERS INTO THE FISCAL SYSTEM (BEFORE RECEIVING IN KIND TRANSFERS IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH). GOVERNMENTS SHOULD EXAMINE WHETHER THIS UNDESIRABLE EFFECT COULD BE AVOIDED, OR AT LEAST REDUCED, THROUGH AN EXPANSION OF TARGETED CASH TRANSFERS AND/OR REDUCTION IN THE CONSUMPTION TAXES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY BURDENSOME FOR THE POOR.\",\n",

METHODS: A TOTAL OF 163 TEACHERS (66.3% WOMEN; AGED 45 +/- 9 YEARS) FILLED OUT A SLEEP DIARY AND WORE A WRIST ACTIGRAPH DEVICE FOR SEVEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM AUGUST 2014 TO MARCH 2015 IN LONDRINA, A LARGE CITY IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL. INTRACLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS (ICC) AND PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS (R) WERE USED TO COMPARE SELF-REPORTED AND ACTIGRAPHIC DATA. RESULTS: SELF-REPORTED TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (SOL), AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY WERE HIGHER THAN MEASURED BY ACTIGRAPHY (MEAN DIFFERENCE: 22.6 +/- 46.9 MIN, 2.6 +/- 13.3 MIN, AND 7.3 +/- 5.7%, RESPECTIVELY). SUBJECTIVE TOTAL TIME IN BED (TIB) AND WAKE-UP TIME WERE LOWER THAN MEASURED BY ACTIGRAPHY (MEAN DIFFERENCE: -10.7 +/- 37.6 AND -19.7 +/- 29.6, RESPECTIVELY). MODERATE OR GOOD AGREEMENT AND CORRELATION WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE SLEEP DIARY AND THE ACTIGRAPHIC DATA FOR TST (ICC = 0.70; R = 0.60), TIB (ICC = 0.83; R = 0.73), BEDTIME (ICC = 0.95; R = 0.91), SLEEP START TIME (ICC = 0.94; R = 0.88), AND WAKE-UP TIME (ICC = 0.87; R = 0.78). HOWEVER, SOL (ICC = 0.49; R = 0.38) AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY (ICC = 0.16; R = 0.22) SHOWED ONLY FAIR OR POOR AGREEMENT AND CORRELATION. CONCLUSION: IN THIS HIGHLY EDUCATED POPULATION, THE SLEEP DIARY AND THE ACTIGRAPHY SHOWED MODERATE OR GOOD AGREEMENT TO ASSESS SEVERAL SLEEP PARAMETERS.

IN THIS PILOT EVALUATION, COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSES IN RURAL GUATEMALA RECEIVED CUSTOMIZED, INTERACTIVE EDUCATION VIA TELEHEALTH FROM FACULTY AT THE SUPPORTING US-BASED INSTITUTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION OF THIS 10 LECTURE SERIES DEMONSTRATED HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION AMONG LEARNERS AND INSTRUCTORS AS WELL AS KNOWLEDGE GAIN BY LEARNERS. AN AVERAGE OF 5.5 LEARNERS AND 2 INSTRUCTORS ATTENDED THE 10 LECTURES AND COMPLETED SURVEYS USING A LIKERT SCALE TO RATE STATEMENTS REGARDING LECTURE CONTENT, TECHNOLOGY, AND PERSONAL CONNECTION. POSITIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT LECTURE CONTENT AND THE APPLICABILITY TO DAILY WORK HAD 98% OR GREATER AGREEMENT AS DID STATEMENTS REGARDING EASE OF TECHNOLOGY AND CONVENIENCE. THE LEARNERS AGREED WITH FEELING CONNECTED TO THE INSTRUCTORS 100% OF THE TIME, WHILE INSTRUCTORS HAD 86.4% AGREEMENT WITH CONNECTION RELATED STATEMENTS. INSTRUCTORS, JOINING AT THEIR RESPECTIVE WORK LOCATIONS, RATED CONVENIENCE STATEMENTS AT 100% AGREEMENT. THIS EVALUATION ALSO DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVENESS WITH AN AVERAGE 10.7% INCREASE IN PRE- TO POSTTEST KNOWLEDGE SCORES BY LEARNERS.

OUR PILOT PROGRAM EVALUATION SHOWS THAT TELEHEALTH MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF DELIVERING EDUCATION TO FRONTLINE HEALTH WORKERS IN RURAL GUATEMALA. WHILE LARGER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO QUANTIFY THE DURATION AND BENEFITS OF SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE GAINS AND TO PERFORM A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM, OUR INITIAL PILOT RESULTS ARE ENCOURAGING AND SHOW THAT A TELEHEALTH PROGRAM BETWEEN A US-BASED UNIVERSITY AND A RURAL COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM IN A LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRY IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE.',\n",

THE PARTICIPANTS WERE 88 MALE AND FEMALE UNDERGRADUATE DENTAL STUDENTS FROM BRAZIL AND PORTUGAL, WITH OR WITHOUT PREVIOUS COLOR EDUCATION AND VISION REFRACTIVE ERRORS (RESPONSE RATE OF 73.33%). THEY WERE ASKED TO MATCH A PAIR SET OF THE SHADE GUIDES VITA CLASSICAL (VC) AND VITAPAN 3D MASTER (3DM), WITH A 20-MINUTES' REST BETWEEN EACH MATCH. THE SETS WERE ASSEMBLED OVER A NEUTRAL GRAY BACKGROUND AND UNDER CONTROLLED LIGHT. ABOUT 7-10 DAYS LATER, ALL PARTICIPANTS WATCHED A VIDEO LECTURE ON COLOR EDUCATION AND REPEATED THE MATCHING PROCEDURE. THE PERCENTAGE OF MATCHES WAS CALCULATED AND SUBMITTED TO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS FOR THE VARIABLES GENDER, GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SHADE GUIDE AND PREVIOUS COLOR EDUCATION (MANN-WHITNEY TESTS), VISION REFRACTIVE ERRORS (KRUSKAL-WALLIS), AND TRAINING (WILCOXON SIGNED RANK). ALL TESTS WERE PERFORMED AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL OF 95%. RESULTSTRAINING INCREASED THE PERCENTAGE OF MATCHES FOR ALL GROUPS, EXCEPT FOR PORTUGUESE AND HYPEROPIC INDIVIDUALS (VC AND 3DM) AND MEN (3DM). PREVIOUS COLOR EDUCATION AFFECTED VC SHADE MATCHING BEFORE TRAINING. GENDER, REFRACTIVE ERRORS, AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION DID NOT AFFECT SHADE MATCHING ABILITY. CONCLUSIONSPREVIOUS EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN COLOR POSITIVELY AFFECTED SHADE-MATCHING ABILITY OF DENTAL STUDENTS ON SHADE GUIDE PAIRING TESTS. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCETHE SUBJECTIVITY OF THE VISUAL METHOD MIGHT NOT BE A CLINICAL CONCERN IN DAILY PRACTICE. THE HUMAN EYE CAN DETECT SMALL DIFFERENCES IN COLOR AND VISUALIZE THE TOOTH WITH ALL ITS COMPLEX GEOMETRY, MULTILAYERED TISSUES, AND SECONDARY COLOR PARAMETERS. THEREFORE, ANY COLOR-MATCHING TASK WILL BE JUDGED BY THE PATIENT AND/OR OTHER OBSERVERS WITH CONSIDERATION TO THIS COMPLEXITY. IN OTHER WORDS, VISUAL ASSESSMENT IS PARAMOUNT TO THE SUCCESS/FAILURE OF ESTHETIC RESTORATIVE PROCEDURES. THE EFFICIENCY OF THE VISUAL COLOR METHOD MAY BE IMPROVED BY COLOR EDUCATION THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL COLOR DISCRIMINATION ABILITY. THIS WOULD MAKE THE STUDENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLOR SELECTION, REPRODUCTION, AND EVALUATION AND LEAD TO INCREASED CAPABILITY OVER A LAYPERSON OBSERVER RECEIVING THE RESTORATIVE TREATMENT.

DIFFERENT STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE ATTENTIONAL CAPACITY IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE SKILLS OF READING, WRITING AND MATH IN PRIMARY SCHOOL. IN THE TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS, A CHILD USES DIFFERENT FORMS OF ATTENTION. IN ONE TASK, THE CHILD SELECTS RELEVANT INFORMATION AND INHIBITS THE OTHERS. PERHAPS, SHOULD DIVIDE HIS ATTENTION AND SWITCH HIS FOCUS OF ATTENTION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE SOURCES OF INFORMATION, HOLDING-INTENTIONALLY THESE ACTIVITIES FOR A SPECIFIED TIME. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS IMPORTANT EVALUATE THE ATTENTIONAL ABILITIES OF CHILDREN IN EDUCATION WITH VALID, RELIABLE AND ADAPTED INSTRUMENTS TO THE SCHOOL POPULATION. THE MAIN PERCEPTUAL-ATTENTIONAL SKILLS USED IN ASSESSING ATTENTIONAL TASKS ARE: PERCEPTION OF DIFFERENCES, VISUAL DISCRIMINATION, VISUAL INTEGRATION AND PERCEPTUAL SPEED. THESE TASKS CAN HE CHARACTERIZED AS SIMPLE, YET INCLUDE A LOT OF TESTS, WHICH REQUIRES A RELATIVELY LARGE TIME TO BE REALIZED. IN THIS WAY BECOME CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TASKS IN WHICH THE SUBJECT MUST LOCATE SIGNIFICANT STIMULUS TO A WIDER SET OF STIMULI ACTING DISTRACTING WAY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NORMATIVE DATA OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN PERCEPTION TEST SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES OR FACES. THIS TEST IS USED TO EVALUATE THE FOCUSED AND SUSTAINED ATTENTION AND THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE, QUICKLY AND CORRECTLY, SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES AND PARTIALLY ORDERED STIMULATING PATTERNS. AS A MAIN FEATURE, THE CARAS, HAS 60 BLOCKS STIMULI EACH COMPOSED OF THREE SCHEMATIC DRAWINGS OF FACES (WITH ELEMENTARY STROKES REPRESENTING THE MOUTH, EYES, EYEBROWS AND HAIR), ONE OF WHICH IS DIFFERENT. THE TASK IS TO DETERMINE THE DIFFERENT SIDE AND CROSS IT OFF. THE RESEARCH WAS DESCRIPTIVE AND CROSS-SECTIONAL NON-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WAS USED. THE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON A STANDARDIZED SAMPLE STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE OF 4.462 STUDENTS BETWEEN 7 AND 12 YEARS OF PUBLIC PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF MENDOZA (REPUBLICA ARGENTINA). AS A RESULT ARE OBTAINED PERFORMANCE ATTENTIONAL SCORES: ATTENTIONAL EFFICACY (AE), ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY (AE) AND ATTENTIONAL YIELD (AY) IN PARTIAL EVALUATION TIME (T1 AND T2) AND TOTAL TIME (T), FOR EACH SEX AND AGE. THESE ATTENTIONAL ASSESSMENT INDICATORS ARE PROPOSED BY THE AUTHORS IN PREVIOUS WORK. MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS DERIVED FROM THESE INDICATORS, EMERGED FROM THE CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW OF THE PROGRESS MADE IN THIS ASSESSMENT TOOL AND THE NEED TO KNOW MORE ACCURATELY THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SUBJECTS TESTED. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE TERM ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE IS INTRODUCED AS AN INCLUSIVE CONCEPT OF ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY, ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY AND ATTENTIONAL YIELD OF A SUBJECT IN VISUAL SEARCH TASKS. ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY ALLOWS TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY WITH WHICH A CHILD DISCRIMINATE STIMULI WITHIN A SERIES OF SIMILAR STIMULI; ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY (AF) IS DEFINED AS THE COGNITIVE ABILITY TO REGULATE AND OPTIMIZE THE ATTENTIONAL MECHANISM TO SELECT AND MAINTAIN ATTENTION FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, USING MINIMAL RESOURCES OF TIME AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, ATTENTIONAL YIELD (AY) IS THE PRODUCT RESULTING FROM THE LEVEL OF EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OBTAINED IN SELECTION AND SUSTAINED ATTENTIONAL TASK. THEN, THE CUMULATIVE FREQUENCIES, WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFORMED TO PERCENTILE RANKS, WERE DETERMINED. WITH THIS KIND OF NORMATIVE STUDY IS TO PROVIDE, IN DIFFERENT ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, GREATER DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY IN ASSESSING ATTENTIONAL MECHANISM IN CHILDREN. THE ATTENTIONAL CAPACITY IS KEY TO PROPER COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING, THUS ITS EVALUATION IS RELEVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF PRECISE DIAGNOSIS AND ADEQUATE PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT INTERRUPT THE CYCLE OF FAILURE AND FRUSTRATION HELPING TO INCREASE THE FEELING OF SELF-EFFICACY IN THE SCHOOL.',\n",

TO THIS END, STATIONARY STATE CALCULATIONS WERE MADE USING IRAM STANDARDS. MONITORING WAS PERFORMED AT THREE KEY TIMES DURING THE YEARS 2013 AND 2014 WITH THE BUILDING UNDER REAL OCCUPATION CONDITIONS. THIS DATA WAS PROCESSED AND RELATED TO DAILY ENERGY CONSUMPTION READINGS. ADDITIONALLY, COMFORT LEVELS IN THREE CLASSROOMS WERE STUDIED USING THE FANGER METHOD, AND PMV AND PPD INDICES WERE DETERMINED WITH A SPECIFIC SOFTWARE. FINALLY, HISTORICAL ELECTRICITY AND GAS CONSUMPTION WERE COMPUTED, AND VALUES PER UNIT AREA WERE CALCULATED, WHICH WERE COMPARED WITH NATIONAL DATA AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. THE ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT, BASED ON THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL DATA, SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT WITH AN AVERAGE ANNUAL CONSUMPTION OF 88 KWH/M2 THE BUILDING MEETS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF SCHOOL ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

WE FOCUS ON THE DISPARITIES IN UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT BETWEEN RICH AND POOR HOUSEHOLDS. WE USE A NOVEL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY THAT INCLUDES SPECIAL TESTS TO MEASURE COGNITIVE AND SOCIO-EMOTIONAL SKILLS OF THE URBAN POPULATION AGE 14-50. THESE ARE COMPLEMENTED WITH RETROSPECTIVE DATA ON BASIC EDUCATION AND FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A MULTINOMIAL MODEL. WE FIND THAT THE STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT AND FAMILY INCOME IN URBAN PERU IS NOT ONLY EXPLAINED BY SHORT-TERM CREDIT CONSTRAINTS, BUT ALSO BY POOR COGNITIVE SKILLS AND BY FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS AFFECTING TASTES AND APTITUDES FOR FORMAL EDUCATION. FAMILY INCOME EXPLAINS, AT MOST, HALF OF THE UNIVERSITY ACCESS GAP BETWEEN POOR AND NON-POOR HOUSEHOLDS. THE OTHER HALF IS RELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN PARENTAL EDUCATION, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS, AND COGNITIVE SKILLS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT CREDIT OR SCHOLARSHIP SCHEMES ALONE WILL NOT SUFFICE TO CHANGE THE REGRESSIVE NATURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION ENROLLMENT IN PERU, AND THAT SUCH PROGRAMS WILL FACE STRONG EQUITY-EFFICIENCY TRADE-OFFS.',\n",

THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN EIGHT SCHOOLS IN COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING THREE PROTECTED AREAS, THROUGH QUESTIONNAIRES FOR 410 MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS HIGHLIGHTED THE UTILITARIAN IMPORTANCE OF FORESTS, BUT APPROXIMATELY 60% OF STUDENTS DID NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTED AREAS, DISPLAYING A DISCONNECTION BETWEEN PERCEPTIONS OF FORESTS AND OF PROTECTED AREAS. THE STUDENTS' ENVIRONMENTAL PERCEPTION INDEX WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN ZONES, BUT IN BOTH ZONES, ON AVERAGE, PROTECTED AREAS HAD A POSITIVE UTILITARIAN IMPORTANCE, EXCLUSIVELY RELATED TO THE PROTECTION OF NATURE. NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF PROTECTED AREAS WERE RELATED TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS LACK OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAND EXPROPRIATION. SCHOOLING AND RESIDENCE SETTING HAD A SMALL (6.7%) BUT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON STUDENT PERCEPTION.

WE EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF DECENTRALIZATION ON ACCESS TO HEALTH AND EDUCATION IN COLOMBIA USING AN ORIGINAL DATABASE COVERING OVER 95 % OF COLOMBIAN MUNICIPALITIES. WE SHOW THAT DECENTRALIZATION IMPROVED ENROLLMENT RATES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ACCESS OF THE POOR TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. IN BOTH SECTORS, IMPROVING ACCESS WAS DRIVEN BY THE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SMALL INCREASES IN OWN-SHARES OF SPENDING LED TO SURPRISINGLY LARGE INCREASES IN THE ACCESS OF THE POOR IN BOTH SECTORS. OUR THEORETICAL MODEL IMPLIES THAT WHERE LOCAL INFORMATION DOMINATES PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY, ELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL PROVIDE SERVICES BETTER TAILORED TO LOCAL NEEDS. DECENTRALIZING SUCH SERVICES SHOULD INCREASE THEIR USE BY THE PUBLIC. TOGETHER, THEORY AND EMPIRICS IMPLY THAT DECENTRALIZATION MADE THE COLOMBIAN STATE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. IT PROVIDED LOCAL OFFICIALS WITH THE INFORMATION AND INCENTIVES THEY NEED TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES IN A MANNER RESPONSIVE TO VOTERS' NEEDS AND IMPROVE THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURES.\",\n",

       "  \"THE CENTRAL AIM OF THIS RESEARCH HINGES UPON THE EVALUATION OF THE EXISTING DEGREE OF DECENTRALIZATION ACROSS TIERS OF GOVERNMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA. THIS IS MADE BY COMPARING THE EXPERIENCE OF FIVE COUNTRIES IN THE AREAS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH. SELECTED CASES INCLUDE TWO MEDIUM SIZE UNITARY COUNTRIES: COLOMBIA AND CHILE; ONE SMALL UNITARY COUNTRY: COSTA RICA; AND TWO BIG FEDERAL ONES: MEXICO AND BRAZIL. THE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED ON THE BASIS OF KEY INFORMANTS INTERVIEWS AND A COMPREHENSIVE REVISION OF THE EXISTING COUNTRY SPECIFIC LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT MATTER. TWO SETS OF RESEARCH OUTPUTS ARE PRESENTED. FIRST, A DESCRIPTION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK IS PROVIDED FOR EACH CASE, THEREBY SUB NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES ARE DEFINED, AND SECOND, AN EVALUATION IS MADE BY LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC EFFICIENCY IMPLICATIONS FROM THE EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AS WELL AS ITS COHERENCE WITH THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT'S FUNCTIONING. MAIN CONCLUSIONS STRESS THE NEED TO LOOK AT COUNTRY SPECIFIC FEATURES WHEN ASSIGNING SUB NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES, WHICH INCLUDES THE GENERAL POLITICAL SETTING IN FORCE, THE ROLE OF UNIONS AND INTEREST GROUPS AND THE CORRESPONDING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS ACROSS TIERS OF GOVERNMENTS RESULTING FROM DECENTRALIZATION. SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE ANALYSIS SHED LIGHT ON UNDERLYING CONFLICTS RESULTING FROM PRO DECENTRALIZATION POLICIES. IN THE CASE OF EDUCATION, A WORTH MENTIONING ASPECT IS THE DEFINITION OF THE TIER OF GOVERNMENT THAT FUNDS TEACHERS' PAYROLL. THIS HAS BEEN AN ASPECT DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH AS IT HAS HAD IMPORTANT FISCAL AND MANAGEMENT RELATED EFFECTS IN THE CASES OF MEXICO, COLOMBIA AND CHILE. A SECOND RELEVANT FACTOR IS THE GREAT HETEROGENEITY ACROSS SUB NATIONAL ENTITIES WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR MANAGEMENT CAPACITIES AND ACCESS TO RESOURCES OF THEIR OWN. THIS POSES MAJOR IMPLICATIONS ON THE TERRITORIAL EQUITY DIMENSION OF DECENTRALIZED SERVICES AND IT REPRESENTS A DIFFICULT OBSTACLE TO OVERCOME EVEN THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMPENSATORY TRANSFERS FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. THUS, IT FOLLOWS THAT A SELECTIVE DECENTRALIZATION POLICY, IN WHICH POTENTIAL MANAGEMENT ADVANTAGES FROM LARGER JURISDICTIONS ARE PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR, ALTHOUGH SMALL AND WEAKER JURISDICTIONS ARE KEPT UNDER CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL, REPRESENTS A REASONABLE SOLUTION IN THE LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT.\",\n",

THE INDICATIONS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAMILY (51.2%) AND PHYSICIANS (33.1%), AND THE SELF-MEDICATION BY 20.8% OF THE STUDENTS. REGARDING THE USE OF MEDICINE 70.9% OF THE STUDENTS WERE NOT INSTRUCTED ON THE PROPER USE OF THE MEDICINE. OF THE TOTAL, 34.1% HAD ALREADY BEEN INFLUENCED BY MEDIA IN THE PURCHASE OF MEDICINE. IT'S POSSIBLE TO CONCLUDE THAT TEENAGERS' KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MEDICINE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON HEALTH IS VERY WEAK AND DEVOID OF ANY BASIC NOTION OF THE RATIONAL USE OF MEDICINE.

THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLORE HOW INITIATIVES FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION ARE EXPERIENCED IN INDIA, BRAZIL AND SOUTH AFRICA. AS SIGNATORIES TO THE IBSA DECLARATION IN THE SPIRIT OF SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION, THE THREE COUNTRIES HAVE PUBLICLY DECLARED THEIR COMMITMENT TO ENHANCE EQUITY BY, FOR EXAMPLE, WIDENING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. WE REVIEW THE WAY IN WHICH THE THREE COUNTRIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED KEY EQUITY INITIATIVES AND DRAW LESSONS FROM THEIR PRACTICE. NOTIONS OF 'EFFECTIVENESS' AND 'EFFICIENCY' ARE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS IS RESPONSIVE TO THE EQUITY AGENDA. WE FIND THAT WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN NOTABLE ATTEMPTS TO IMPLEMENT THE EQUITY AGENDA IN THE QUEST FOR MAKING THEIR SYSTEMS MORE 'SOCIALLY EFFECTIVE'. THIS IS COUNTERVAILED BY A MORE PERVASIVE 'EFFICIENCY' DOCTRINE, UNDERPINNED BY A MARKET-DRIVEN ECONOMIC PARADIGM. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE INNOVATIVE PRACTICES IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES SUGGEST IMPORTANT STRIDES IN THE EQUITY AGENDA BUT ALSO THAT MUCH STILL REMAINS TO BE DONE.

WE ANALYZE HEALTH EQUATIONS THAT RELATE HEALTH TO EDUCATION AND OTHER VARIABLES. HEALTH IS MEASURED IN TERMS OF SELF-REPORTED OVERALL HEALTH, AN INDEX OF BIOLOGICAL RISK FACTORS, AND BODY MASS INDEX. THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS TESTED IS WHETHER EDUCATION HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON IMMIGRANTS' PRODUCTIVE AND ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY, BECAUSE OF THEIR NEED TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO REMAIN HEALTHY AND ACCESS APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE IN A NEW ENVIRONMENT. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT FOR US RESIDENTS, WHO WERE FOREIGN-BORN, EDUCATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON EVERY HEALTH OUTCOME COMPARED TO THOSE BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. MORE EDUCATION IS RELATED TO AN EVEN GREATER POSITIVE EFFECT ON HEALTH FOR IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO, THE ORIGIN OF MOST IMMIGRANTS, THAN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE PORTIONS OF THE 2007 IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT REJECTED BY THE US CONGRESS, WHICH PLACED A HIGHER PRIORITY ON EDUCATION AND JOB SKILLS THAN CURRENT LAW.

OUT OF 22 POSSIBLE POINTS INCLUDED IN THE SUICIDE KNOWLEDGE EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE, THE AVERAGE RESULT ON FIRST ANSWERING WAS 12.59 CORRECT ANSWERS, WHICH ROSE TO 15.97 UPON COMPLETING THE, WORKSHOP. THE RANGE OF GRADES WAS INCREASED ONE POINT FOR BOTH THE MINIMUM AND THE MAXIMUM VALUES AND STANDARD DEVIATION WAS REDUCED FROM 2.62 TO 2.49. THE INCREASE IN SUICIDE KNOWLEDGE WAS THEN PROVED THROUGH A &lt;&lt; T &gt;&gt; TEST FOR TWO DEPENDENT SAMPLES SINCE IT SHOWED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULT INCREASE (P &lt; 0.001). THE BENEFITS OF THE WORKSHOP WERE TESTED THROUGH ATTENDANTS' COMMENTS AND COORDINATORS REPORTS ANALYSES. TEARING DOWN OF SUICIDE MYTHS SUCH AS THE CONFUSION BETWEEN THE EMBRACING OF SUICIDE IDEAS, AND THEIR ACTUAL FULFILLMENT, THE CONSIDERATION OF SUICIDE AS A SIGN OF, EITHER BRAVERY OR MENTAL ILLNESS, THE NOTION THAT TALKING,ABOUT SUICIDE WITH,SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPRESSED HIS WISH FOR COMMITTING SUICIDE IS TACTLESS OR THAT A SUICIDAL DOES NOT SHOW ANY WARNING SIGNALS WERE OUTSTANDING ELEMENTS. THE WORKSHOP EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE, OBJECTIVE FULFILLMENT, WORKSHOP METHODOLOGY, TIME MANAGEMENT AND TOPIC SELECTION WERE ALL PRAISED BY THE ATTENDANTS. THE THIRD WORKSHOP EVALUATION INSTRUMENT INVOLVED THE COORDINATORS REPORTS, THUS CORROBORATING THE WORKSHOP REACH AND GAINING FURTHER INFORMATION: SIX OF THE ATTENDANTS KNEW SOMEONE WHO HAD TRIED SUICIDE; SEVEN MORE HAD EMBRACED SUICIDAL IDEAS, OF WHOM FIVE ACTUALLY TRIED THEM OUT ACTIVELY. &lt;&lt; SAVING LIVES &gt;&gt; LEFT AMONGST ITS CONCLUSIONS THE FACT THAT 12 OUT OF 69 ATTENDANTS ACKNOWLEDGED HAVING EITHER EMBRACED OR TRIED SUICIDE PREVIOUSLY. THIS COULD HAVE PROVED MOTIVATION ENOUGH SO AS TO BECOME &lt;&lt; INFORMED GUARDIANS &gt;&gt; AND PIN-POINTS THE IMPORTANCE OR TEENAGE PREVENTION, FOR NOT ONLY ARE THEY THE GROUP WITH THE,HIGHEST RISK BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE FIRST TO KNOW OF CHANGES AND/OR SUICIDE RISK WITHIN THEIR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. BESIDES, WHEN TRAINED AS SUICIDE PREVENTION AGENTS, THEY MAY SPREAD THE WORD AND ADEQUATE INFORMATION NOT ONLY IN SCHOOL-BASED ENVIRONMENT'S,BUT WHEREVER THE HAPPEN TO INTERACT, BE IT AT HOME OR RECREATIONAL CENTERS, AMONGST MANY OTHERS. ANOTHER BENEFIT THAT STEMS FROM THE WORKSHOP IS AN EVEN MORE ACCURATE DEFINITION OF SUICIDE CONCEPTS. SEVERAL SUICIDE MYTHS WERE CLARIFIED. THE FACT THAT THE WORKSHOP COORDINATORS WERE STUDENTS WAS REGARDED AS POSITIVE BY BOTH ATTENDANTS AND THE COORDINATORS THEMSELVES. IN SPITE OF THE APPALLING INCREASE IN MORTALITY FIGURES DUE TO SUICIDE, THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN MEXICO, AND THE SCARCE ONES ARE UTTERLY LIMITED. THE PROPOSED WORKSHOP PROVED A MEANS OF EFFECTIVE OBJECTIVE REACH SINCE NOT ONLY DOES IT PROVIDE INFORMATION PERTAINING SPECIFIC SUICIDE FACTS BUT ALSO FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS AND HELPING POSSIBILITIES EMBODIED BY THE &lt;&lt; INFORMED GUARDIANS &gt;&gt;. MOREOVER, THANKS TO HAVING BEEN DESIGNED BASED ON PREVIOUS STUDIES OF THE SOME POPULATION, IT IS SO FLEXIBLE A PROJECT THAT IT CAN BE ADOPTED FOR FURTHER USE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. SUCH AN EXTENSIVE AND URGENT TASK AS SUICIDE PREVENTION SHOULD SUMMON THE COMBINED EFFORT OF ALL SOCIAL SPHERES. THE ESTABLISHED MISCONCEPTION THAT SUICIDE CARE IS A RESPONSIBILITY CONSTRAINED TO CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS, LIMITS THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY SO MUCH AS THE SOCIETY'S, AS WELL AS PREVENTION ITSELF. AN EFFECTIVE DISPEL OF SUCH CONCEPTION AMONGST YOUNG ATTENDANTS WAS ANOTHER ACHIEVEMENT OF THE WORKSHOP. THE CHALLENGE NOW IS TO REACH COOPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH ALL SOCIAL PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE A WORD IN IT SO AS TO STOP AND REVERT THE CURRENT INCREASING TREND IN SUICIDE.\",\n",

THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ATTENDING EVENING CLASSES (19:00-22:30 H) AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL. THE STUDY GROUP CONSISTED OF WORKING (N = 51) AND NON-WORKING (N = 41) STUDENTS, AGED 14-21 YRS. THE STUDENTS ANSWERED A QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS AND REPORTED HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND DISEASES. FOR SEVEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS, ACTIGRAPHY MEASUREMENTS WERE RECORDED, AND THE STUDENTS ALSO FILLED IN A SLEEP DIARY. SLEEPINESS RATINGS WERE GIVEN SIX TIMES PER DAY, INCLUDING UPON WAKING AND AT BEDTIME, USING THE KAROLINSKA SLEEPINESS SCALE. STATISTICAL ANALYSES INCLUDED THREE-WAY ANOVA AND T-TEST. THE MEAN SLEEP DURATION DURING WEEKDAYS WAS SHORTER AMONG WORKERS (7.2 H) THAN NON-WORKERS (8.8 H) (T = 4.34; P &lt;.01). THE MEAN DURATION OF NIGHT AWAKENINGS WAS LONGER AMONG WORKERS ON TUESDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS (28.2 MIN) AND SHORTER ON MONDAYS (24.2 MIN) (T = 2.57; P =.03). AMONG WORKERS, MEAN NAPPING DURATION WAS LONGER ON MONDAYS AND TUESDAYS (89.9 MIN) (T = 2.27; P =.03) BUT SHORTER ON FRIDAYS AND SUNDAYS (31.4 MIN) (T = 3.13; P =.03). SLEEP EFFICIENCY WAS LOWER ON FRIDAYS AMONG NON-WORKERS. WORKING STUDENTS WERE MODERATELY SLEEPIER THAN NON-WORKERS DURING THE WEEK AND ALSO DURING CLASS ON SPECIFIC DAYS: MONDAYS (13:00-15:00H), WEDNESDAYS (19:00-22:00H), AND FRIDAYS (22:00-00:59H). THE STUDY FOUND THAT DAYTIME SLEEPINESS OF WORKERS IS MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE EVENING. THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO A WORK EFFECT, REDUCING THE AVAILABLE TIME FOR SLEEP AND SHORTENING THE SLEEP DURATION. SLEEPINESS AND SHORTER SLEEP DURATION CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND SCHOOL DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.',\n",

IN THIS PAPER, WE APPROACH THE PROBLEM OF INSTITUTIONAL EFFICIENCY VERSUS SOCIAL INCLUSION IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY THROUGH THE CASE STUDY OF THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF A SOCIAL GROUP OF RECENT PARTICIPATION IN A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN VENEZUELA, ESPECIFICALLY THAT OF STUDENT MOTHERS IN THE UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES. THIS WORK INVESTIGATES HOW STUDENT MOTHERS MAKE USE OF THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES OPENED TO THEM AND HOW THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IS AFFECTED BY THEIR PARTICULAR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENT MOTHERS IS LOWER THAN THAT OF OTHER GROUPS OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. IN PRACTICE, STUDENT MOTHERS PARTICIPATE AS PART-TIME STUDENTS, ALTHOUGH THIS CATEGORY IS NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED BY MOST VENEZUELAN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. ALMOST ALL THE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES OF STUDENT MOTHERS NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CONTRIBUTES POSITIVELY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF A STUDENT MOTHER IS THE HELP PROVIDED BY HER EXTENDED FAMILY IN TAKING CARE OF HER CHILDREN. THE FACT THAT STUDENT MOTHERS ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS MAINLY DUE TO THE HELP THEY RECEIVE FROM THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY. THIS IS A DISTINCTIVE CULTURAL FEATURE ASSOCIATED TO THIS SOCIAL GROUP IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SUCH AS VENEZUELA.',\n",

DESIGN AND METHODS: CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 66 GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS, INCLUDING CHILDREN IN THE ADMISSIONS CLASSES (AGED 4 TO 7 YEARS) AND CLASSES FOR 'RISING NINES' (AGED 7-10 YEARS). DATA INCLUDED QUESTIONNAIRE DETAILS OF FREE SCHOOL MEALS AND CHILDREN'S SOCIAL BACKGROUND, AND MEASUREMENTS OF CHILDREN'S HEIGHTS, WEIGHTS AND SKINFOLD THICKNESSES. RESULTS: OF 6731 ELIGIBLE CHILDREN, DATA WERE ANALYSED FOR 5688 (85%). THERE WERE 2386 (42%) CHILDREN RECEIVING FREE MEALS PROVIDED AT SCHOOL. AT DIFFERENT SCHOOLS THE PROPORTION OF ALL CHILDREN RECEIVING FREE MEALS RANGED FROM 20% TO 100%, P &lt; 0.001. RECEIPT OF FREE MEALS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGER FAMILY SIZE (ONE CHILD, 32% RECEIVED FREE MEALS; :6 CHILDREN, 63%), LOWER PATERNAL EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT (PRIMARY, 52% FREE; UNIVERSITY, 30%, FATHER'S EMPLOYMENT (EMPLOYED, 39% FREE MEALS; UNEMPLOYED &gt;12 MONTHS, 59%) AS WELL AS MATERNAL EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSEHOLD AMENITIES.

       "  \"DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES, LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRESSURE TO ABANDON THE MAIN PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED IN THE 1918 CORDOBA REFORM (I.E., AUTONOMY AND AUTARCHY). WHILE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION HAS DECLINED, THEY ARE PRESSURED TO RELINQUISH A LARGE PORTION OF INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE TO MARKET DEMANDS AND TO A NEW SET OF CONTROL STRATEGIES EMANATING FROM THE STATE. WE ARGUE THAT CURRENT CHANGES IN LATIN AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION CANNOT BE EXAMINED IN ISOLATION FROM LARGER POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES IN THE REGION, WHICH IN TURN ARE RELATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF GLOBALIZATION. AFTER THE DECLINE OF SOCIALIST AND WELFARE-STATE MODELS, NEOLIBERAL REGIMES HAVE BECOME HEGEMONIC IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN MOST COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, COUPLED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS, HAVE FORCED UNIVERSITIES TO RECONSIDER THEIR SOCIAL MISSIONS, ACADEMIC PRIORITIES AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES. CONCERNS ABOUT EQUITY, ACCESSIBILITY, AUTONOMY OR THE CONTRIBUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION, WHICH WERE PREVALENT DURING PREVIOUS DECADES, HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY CONCERNS ABOUT EXCELLENCE, EFFICIENCY, EXPENDITURES AND RATES OF RETURN. THE NOTION THAT HIGHER EDUCATION IS PRIMARILY A CITIZEN'S RIGHT AND A SOCIAL INVESTMENT - WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED FOR MANY DECADES - IS BEING SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED BY A NEOLIBERAL AGENDA THAT PLACES EXTREME FAITH IN THE MARKET. THOUGH WE FOCUS ON THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION OF UNIVERSITY CHANGE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT GLOBAL TRENDS ARE PROMOTED, RESISTED AND NEGOTIATED DIFFERENTLY IN EACH NATIONAL CONTEXT AND IN EACH INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTION. IN THE EMERGING KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOCIETY, THE POLARIZATION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE EVEN FURTHER IF THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL GAPS ARE NOT NARROWED. LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES HAVE A CRUCIAL ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS REGARD. THE PAPER IS ORGANIZED IN TWO PARTS. THE FIRST DESCRIBES THE CONTEXT OF UNIVERSITY CHANGE, FOCUSING ON ISSUES OF GLOBALIZATION AND NEOLIBERALISM. THE SECOND EXAMINES THE MAIN FEATURES OF UNIVERSITY RESTRUCTURING IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON LATIN AMERICA.\",\n",

THE CURRICULUM DOMAINS WHICH PROVIDED GUIDANCE IN THE PROCESS WERE MENTAL DISCIPLINE, CHILD STUDY, SOCIAL EFFICIENCY AND HUMANISM, AND THE INDICATORS GLEANED FROM EACH OF THESE IDEOLOGICAL CAMPS CAME TOGETHER AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD AND COLLECTIVELY INFORMED CURRICULUM CHOICE AND PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES.

THIS NEW FORM OF CENTRALIZATION/DECENTRALIZATION IS SEEN AS LINKED TO THE NEOLIBERAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE STATE, TO PRESSURES FROM GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES AND FORCES, AND TO VARIOUS INTERNAL DEMANDS FOR IMPROVING QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY IN THE DELIVERY OF EDUCATION.',\n",

THE RECENT HISTORIES OF THESE COUNTRIES AND THEIR CURRENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS ARE ANALYZED IN RELATION TO THREE INTERRELATED THEMES THAT HAVE EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE THREE CASES. THESE THEMES ARE: (1) LINKAGES TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS: HIGHER EDUCATION AS VOCATIONAL TRAINING, (2) STANDARDIZATION, EFFICIENCY, AND TECHNOCRACY, AND (3) WHO CONTROLS THE CURRICULUM?

PURE TECHNICAL, ALLOCATIVE AND ECONOMIC) MEASURES WERE LOWER AND MORE VARIABLE IN CARIBBEAN THAN IN OTHER WESTERN HEMISPHERE COUNTRIES (I.E. NORTH AMERICA AND LATIN AMERICA). TOBIT REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATED HIGHER LEVELS OF PRIVATE AND FOREIGN INVESTMENTS, PRODUCTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDIT AVAILABILITY, EDUCATION LEVEL, AND CONSUMPTION OF DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED GOODS HAD POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE EFFICIENCY MEASURES. ON THE OTHER HAND, HIGHER LEVELS OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, INCOME TAX, AND EXPORT TAXES, AND HIGHER INFLATION RATES HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE CURRENT TREND TOWARDS ADVOCATING MORE OPEN ECONOMIES (I.E. LETTING THE FREE MARKET WORK) AND ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENTS TO CONFINE THEIR FUNCTIONS TO FACILITATIVE/REGULATORY TYPE ROLES AND TO UNDERTAKING TASKS THAT ARE NOT GENERALLY UNDERTAKEN BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR (E.G. DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE, PROVIDING EDUCATION). ALTHOUGH, GENERALLY, THE SAME FACTORS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH EFFICIENCY IN THE CARIBBEAN AND LATIN AMERICA, THEIR RELATIVE IMPACTS DIFFERED. CONSEQUENTLY, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY IN THE CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES, RELATIVELY GREATER EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON ENCOURAGING FOREIGN AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.',\n",

       "  'A LARGE NUMBER OF DEVELOPING NATIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DECENTRALIZING BASIC EDUCATION, WITH THE AIM OF DIVERSIFYING REVENUE SOURCES AND INTRODUCING GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND EFFICIENCY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN LATIN AMERICA, WHERE CHILE INTRODUCED THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT REFORM IN 1981. THIS REFORM KEPT MOST OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATIONAL FINANCE WITH THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION BUT TRANSFERRED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DELIVERING SERVICES TO MUNICIPALITIES AND NON-PROFIT, PRIVATE SCHOOLS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS REFORM, MUNICIPALITIES INCREASED THEIR FINANCE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND THE SUPPLY OF SUBSIDIZED PRIVATE EDUCATION INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. BY 1990, ENROLLMENT IN SUBSIDIZED PRIVATE SCHOOLS REPRESENTED ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF TOTAL PRIMARY-SECONDARY SCHOOL ENROLLMENTS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF THE REFORM. MUNICIPAL FINANCE, WHICH IS CLOSELY TIED TO MUNICIPAL FISCAL CAPACITY, HAS CREATED INEQUITIES IN SCHOOL EXPENDITURES EVEN THOUGH IT REPRESENTS ONLY 10% OF TOTAL REVENUES. VARIATIONS IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL MARKET SHARE ACROSS MUNICIPALITIES ARE PRINCIPALLY EXPLAINED BY THE EASE OF MARKET ENTRY, FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS; THIS MODEL DOES NOT OFFER A SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION OF THE GROWTH IN PRIVATE SCHOOL ENROLLMENTS IN CHILE OVER TIME. THE EFFECT OF THE REFORM ON COST-EFFECTIVENESS IS AMBIGUOUS. MINISTRY OF EDUCATION NON-TEACHER EMPLOYMENT DECLINED BY OVER HALF, WHILE COGNITIVE TESTS ALSO DECLINED. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE GROWTH IN PRIVATE SCHOOL ENROLLMENTS MAY HAVE IMPROVED OVERALL EFFICIENCY SINCE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE FOUND TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

       "  'THE QUALITY GAP IN EDUCATION BETWEEN CHILEAN SCHOOLS WITH DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES (ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SUBSIDIZED SCHOOLS) HAS LONG BEEN A SUBJECT OF ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION WITHIN THE WIDER DEBATE SURROUNDING THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY AND ROLE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. UNCONDITIONED DIFFERENCES IN THE RESULTS OF STANDARDIZED TESTS THAT POINT TO HIGHER LEVELS OF QUALITY IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS DIMINISH WHEN SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ARE CONTROLLED FOR, BUT THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT CONTROL VARIABLES SHOULD BE USED AND WHICH METHODOLOGY IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE EXTENT OF THE REDUCTION, ALL CONTINUE TO BE A SUBJECT OF DEBATE. HERE WE UNDERTAKE A META-ANALYSIS OF 17 OF THE MAIN STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON THE SUBJECT. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS HOW SENSITIVE THE RESULTS ARE TO THE CONTROLS AND ESTIMATION METHODS THAT ARE USED. IN THE AGGREGATE, PRIVATE SUBSIDIZED SCHOOLS SCORE APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINTS HIGHER THAN MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS DO. THIS IS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND EDUCATIONALLY RELEVANT DIFFERENTIAL.',\n",

       "  \"THE CHILEAN VOUCHER SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED DURING THE EIGHTIES, ALLOWS PARENTS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND PRIVATE SUBSIDIZED SCHOOLS. IT'S MAIN PURPOSE WAS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SECTOR. DESPITE THE IMPROVEMENTS SUGGEST BY SOME INDICATORS, THERE IS TODAY WIDESPREAD CONCERN THAT THE CHILEAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAS LAGGED BEHIND THE COUNTRY'S REQUIREMENTS AND THAT MANY INEFFICIENCIES AND INEQUITIES PERSIST. THE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS ARE CONTROVERSIAL, BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SOME ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL MARKET, AS WELL AS SOME REGULATIONS, PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE ON IT. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, NON PROFIT INSTITUTIONS, LIKE THOSE BELONGING TO RELIGIOUS ORDERS OR THE MUNICIPALITIES, COEXIST WITH PROFIT MAXIMIZING ESTABLISHMENTS. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS, WHICH IN SOME CASES MAY BE FAR REMOVED FROM THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN OFFERING BEST QUALITY EDUCATION. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE REGULATIONS WHICH DO NOT ALLOW MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS TO BE EFFICIENTLY MANAGED. ON THE DEMAND SIDE, THERE ARE PARENTS WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES, TIME AND INCOME CONSTRAINTS AND ALSO DIFFERENT SHADOW PRICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. THIS IMPLIES THAT EVEN IF THERE EXISTED A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONCEPT OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY, THESE PARENTS WOULD WANT TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION SPACE, EVEN UNDER A FREE ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO REVIEW ISSUES RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL MARKET, AS WELL AS THE INCENTIVE SCHEMES AND CONSTRAINTS FACED BY SUPPLIERS AND DEMANDERS OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER ANALYZES WHETHER UNDER PRESENT MARKET CONDITIONS, IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT SUBSIDIZED SCHOOLS TO COMPETE AMONG EACH OTHER OFFERING BETTER QUALITY OF EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SUBSIDIES IMPLY HIGHER LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY, IS EXAMINED. THIS STUDY, WHICH ASSUMES INFORMATIONAL SYMMETRY AND A STATIC FRAMEWORK, CONCLUDES THAT MANY CONDITIONS HAVE TO BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED RESULTS IN TERMS OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY, IF A VOUCHER SYSTEM LIKE THE CHILEAN IS APPLIED. AMONG THESE CONDITIONS ARE THE ABSENCE OF LOCAL MONOPOLIES, THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES TO ALLOW THE EXPANSION OF SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS, THE PROMOTION OF PARENTS' INTEREST IN A GOOD EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN, THE REMOVAL OF THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE ESTATUTO DOCENTE, AND THE REVISION OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION--OR THE INCENTIVE SCHEME--OF THOSE WHO MANAGE THE MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MORE CONSISTENT WITH QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY PURPOSES.\",\n",

BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS AND STRONG CRITICS AGAINST THIS MODE OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED THE CONALEP SYSTEM IN THE LATE 1970S. THIS STUDY TESTS THE VIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM BY EVALUATING CONALEP GRADUATES' LABOR MARKET PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER FORMS OF EDUCATION. IT ALSO SUPPLEMENTS THE SCANT LITERATURE ON THE TRANSITION FROM TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO WORK AND ON THE USE OF TECHNICAL SKILLS. THROUGH INNOVATIONS - INTER ALIA, AN AUTONOMOUS NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS, STRONG LINKS TO INDUSTRY USE OF INDUSTRY-EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTORS, TERMINAL PROGRAM WITH MODEST COST RECOVERY, AND HIGHLY PRACTICAL COURSES - CONALEP HAS FORGED AN EFFECTIVE TECHNICAL SECONDARY EDUCATION SYSTEM AIMED AT THE MEXICAN LABOR MARKET WITH SUBSTANTIAL SPILL-OVER EFFECTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS A MEXICAN PROGRAM, THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE CONALEP SYSTEM BEAR POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL. WITH GLOBALIZATION AND RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS OF THE MEXICAN ECONOMY, HOWEVER, THIS ALTERNATIVE FORM OF TECHNICAL SECONDARY EDUCATION FACES NEW CHALLENGES, NOTABLY ADJUSTMENT OF ITS CURRICULUM TO CHANGING MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND IMPROVEMENT OF ITS EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL EFFICIENCY.

METHOD: WE USED A QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGY WITH A NON-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, WHICH FOLLOWS THE CORRELATIONAL METHOD RESTULTING IN AN EX-POST-FACTO STUDY. AS AN INSTRUMENT WE USED THE ESEA-2, A REVIEW OF THE SDQ-II OF MARSH DONE BY GONZALEZ-PIENDA, WHICH STUDIES THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF THE SELF-CONCEPT OF ADOLESCENTS WHO ATTEND THE SECOND YEAR OF COMPULSORY SECONDARY EDUCATION (ESO) (N=2,701) IN THE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF MADRID. RESULTS. THE RESULTS OF THE DESCRIPTIVE AND CORRELATIONAL STUDIES SHOW THAT IN THE CASE OF EMOTIONAL STABILITY THERE ARE NO DIFFERENCES REFERRING TO GENDER, EXCEPT FOR THE BOYS OF ECUADORIAN ORIGIN WHO HAD MORE EMOTIONAL STABILITY THAN THE ECUADORIAN GIRLS. NEVERTHELESS, WE FOUND DIFFERENCES REFERRING TO THE COUNTRY OR GROUP OF ORIGIN. WE ALSO FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES, SOME OF THEM WITH NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS AND OTHERS WITH POSITIVE CORRELATIONS DEPENDING ON HOW THEY VALUED SPANISH CULTURE AND THEIR ORIGINAL CULTURE. DISCUSSION. CONSIDERING THAT THIS DIMENSION OF THE SELF-CONCEPT IMPLIES THE DEGREE OF STRESS AND CONCERN SHOWN BY THE STUDENTS DUE TO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WHICH THEY HAVE TO SOLVE DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS OF THE EGO, IT IS RELEVANT TO DETECT THAT THERE ARE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE SUBJECTS AND THIS MAY INDICATE THE EFFICIENCY OF INTERVENTIONS CONCERNING GENDER EQUALITY. BUT WE DETECTED DIFFERENCES RELATED TO NATIONALITY OR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. HERE WE FOUND AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS DIMENSION OF THE SELF-CONCEPT AND THE VALUE WHICH THEY GIVE TO THEIR ORIGINAL CULTURE AND THE SPANISH CULTURE. AS A CONCLUSION, WE FIND IT NECESSARY TO DESIGN INVESTIGATIONS WHICH CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCES REGARDING THE VALUE OF CULTURES DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENT ORIGINS OF THE SUBJECTS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFICIENT INTERVENTIONS.',\n",

THE PRIVATIZATION OF STUDENT DEBT, MASSIVE AND DEREGULATED EXTENSION OF CREDIT, THEY CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR A 'STUDENT DEBT CRISIS' TO ARISE. HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH CRISIS MAY TRIGGER THE RISE OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS OF DEBTORS, DEPENDS ON FACTORS SUCH AS EXISTING CONCEPTIONS ABOUT DEBT AND SOCIAL RIGHTS, INSTITUTIONAL INCENTIVES, AND THE EXISTENCE OF POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS.\",\n",

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THEORY WAS EMPLOYED TO DESCRIBE AND CONCEPTUALIZE THE UNIVERSITIES' RESPONSES TO FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. THE CONCEPTS OF INSTITUTIONAL RULES AND RATIONAL MYTHS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PROCESSES THAT LEAD ORGANIZATIONS TO BECOME SIMILAR TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT WERE UTILIZED TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ON DECISION-MAKING IN TIMES OF FISCAL UNCERTAINTY. RESULTS INDICATE THAT FINANCIAL STRESS WAS MANAGED THROUGH ECONOMIC MEASURES, HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITIES' INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT FILTERED AND GAVE SPECIFIC MEANING TO PARTICULAR DECISION STRATEGIES. INSTITUTIONAL RULES IN THE ENVIRONMENT, ACQUIRING THE CHARACTER OF RATIONALIZED MYTHS, PERMEATED AND DETERMINED DECISION-MAKING CHOICES, AND WERE EVIDENCED IN AND SUSTAINED BY MIMETIC, NORMATIVE AND COERCIVE PROCESSES.

ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY (AE) IS DEFINED AS THE ACCURACY WITH WHICH A CHILD DISCRIMINATES, FROM A GROUP OF SIMILAR STIMULI, THOSE WHICH ARE IDENTICAL TO A MODEL, WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD. VARIOUS FACTORS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER OR LOWER AE, AMONG WHICH IS SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT. THE GOALS OF THIS STUDY WERE: 1) TO DESCRIBE ARGENTINE STUDENTS' ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SCHOOL (PRIVATE-PUBLIC), ACCORDING TO THE STUDENTS' AGE AND GENDER AND ACOORDING TO THE EDUCATIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL LEVEL OF THE STUDENTS' MOTHERS; 2) TO COMPARE ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SCHOOL (PRIVATEPUBLIC), STUDENTS' AGE AND GENDER AND EDUCATIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL LEVEL OF THEIR MOTHERS. METHOD. A COMPARATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS USED. TWO GROUPS OF 10-TO-13-YEAR-OLD STUDENTS WERE FORMED: 74 FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS (MEAN 11.26; S.D. 0.93; 53% BOYS AND 47% GIRLS) AND 67 STUDENTS (MEAN 11.49; S. D. 1.05; 54% BOYS AND 46% GIRLS) FROM A PRIVATE SCHOOLS. TYPE OF SCHOOL IS CATEGORIZED BY MENDOZA GENERAL BOARD OF EDUCATION. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED IN URBAN AREAS. PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE SITUATED IN PERIPHERAL AREAS IN CONTEXTS OF SOCIAL VULNERABILITY. SOCIAL VULNERABILITY IS A CONDITION OF SOCIAL RISK THAT HINDERS, EITHER IMMEDIATELY OR IN THE LONG TERM, THE SATISFACTION OF WELFARE NEEDS, BOTH IN TERMS OF SURVIVAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE. IN THIS KIND OF CONTEXTS THERE ARE LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION IN THE FAMILIES, POOR WORKING CONDITIONS AND/OR UNEMPLOYMENT, FAMILIES DYSFUNCTION AND POOR MOTHER AND CHILD HEALTH SERVICES. ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS LEAD TO UNEQUAL SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND DECREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE 10 PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN PERIPHERAL AREAS AND 25 PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN URBAN AREAS AT GUAYMALLEN, MENDOZA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FROM TWO SCHOOLS, ONE FROM PUBLIC AND OTHER FROM PRIVATE SCHOOL. RESULTS. THE RESULTS REVEALED LOWER ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY IN SCHOOL CHILDREN ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAN IN THOSE ATTENDING A PRIVATE SCHOOLS. NO STATISTICALLY-SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY IN RELATION TO THE GENDER OR AGE OF THE PARTICIPATING CHILDREN. THE STUDENTS WHOSE MOTHERS HAD ATTAINED A UNIVERSITY LEVEL OF EDUCATION SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE, IN CONTRAST WITH THOSE STUDENTS WHOSE MOTHERS HAD ONLY ATTENDED PRIMARY SCHOOL. IN ADITTION, THE STUDENTS WHOSE MOTHERS WERE EMPLOYED SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE IN CONSTRAST WITH THOSE CHILDREN WHOSE MOTHERS WERE UNEMPLOYED. NERVERTHELESS, NO STATISTICALLY-SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN ATTENTIONAL EFFICIENCY IN RELATION TO OCCUPATIONAL LEVEL OF QUALIFICATION OF STUDENTS' MOTHERS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY CONCURS WITH RESEARCH SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT ON CHILDREN'S ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE, CONTRIBUTING EVIDENCE ON THE NEED TO ADJUST EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES AND COGNITIVE INTERVENTIONS TO BOOST CHILDREN'S ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS.\",\n",

       "  'SINCE THE MID-1990S, THERE HAS BEEN AN ABRUPT GROWTH OF DOCTORAL ENROLLMENTS AND DOCTORAL PROGRAMS IN ARGENTINA AND LATIN AMERICA. HOWEVER, COMPLETION RATES AT THIS EDUCATION LEVEL ARE FAR FROM SATISFYING. ATTRITION RATES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES DOCTORAL PROGRAMS \"ARE KNOWN\" TO BE HIGH, AND HIGHER IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (WHICH WILL BE LATER CALLED \"SOFT SCIENCES\") THAN IN STEM (WHICH WILL BE LATER CALLED \"HARD SCIENCES\") DISCIPLINES, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO VALID AND RELIABLE DATA. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE CARRIED OUT AN INVESTIGATION WITH TWO OBJECTIVES: (1) TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE (EFFICIENCY OR PRODUCTIVITY) IN 18 DOCTORAL PROGRAMS IN STEM DISCIPLINES, THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, AND HUMANITIES AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IN BUENOS AIRES CITY AND THE SURROUNDING METROPOLITAN AREA; AND (2) TO DESIGN A PROCEDURE FOR COLLECTING VALID AND RELIABLE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ASSESS DOCTORAL PROGRAMS\\' PERFORMANCE. THIS MEASURE WAS DEFINED ALONG TWO DIMENSIONS: COMPLETION RATES (REGULAR TIME RATES AND EXTRA TIME RATES) AND AVERAGE TIME-TO-DEGREE BY COHORT. WE COMPILED DATA ON INDIVIDUALS\\' ACADEMIC TRACKS IN EACH COHORT FROM THEIR ENROLLMENT TO THEIR COMPLETION OR DROPOUT BY USING PAPER-FILES AND DIGITIZED DATABASES PROVIDED BY ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS. INFORMATION WAS ANALYZED BY PROGRAM, BY COHORT, AND BY SIX GROUPED COHORTS FOR 2001-2006. SUBSTANTIVE AND METHODOLOGICAL RESULTS WERE FOUND. AMONG THE SUBSTANTIVE RESULTS, WE DISCOVERED BETTER PERFORMANCE IN STEM DISCIPLINES THAN IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES. AS TO THE METHODOLOGICAL RESULTS, POSTGRADUATE STATISTICAL REGISTERING MATRIX WAS DESIGNED AND A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED FOR USE BY DOCTORAL PROGRAMS AND GRADUATE PROGRAMS GENERALLY.',\n",

USING A COMMON SAMPLING METHODOLOGY AND SURVEY INSTRUMENTS, RESEARCHERS IN EACH COUNTRY COLLECTED REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF DATA ON THIRD- AND FOURTH-GRADE ACHIEVEMENT IN LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS, AS WELL AS BACKGROUND SURVEYS FROM STUDENTS, PARENTS, TEACHERS, AND PRINCIPALS. THIS ARTICLE USES THESE DATA AND MULTILEVEL MODELING TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN 10 OF THESE COUNTRIES. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT MANY PRIOR STUDIES HAVE MISREPRESENTED THE PRIVATE SCHOOL EFFECT BY FAILING TO CONTROL FOR THE CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDENT PEER GROUPS. IN THESE STUDIES, THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN THE TWO SECTORS MAY PARTLY OR ENTIRELY REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF BETTER PEER GROUP CHARACTERISTICS, AS OPPOSED TO ANY SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT OF PRIVATE SCHOOL PRACTICES OR EFFICIENCY ON THE OUTCOMES OF THEIR STUDENTS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CONDITIONING ON A COMPLETE SET OF STUDENT, FAMILY, AND PEER CHARACTERISTICS EXPLAINS A LARGE PORTION OF THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCE IN ACHIEVEMENT BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. ACROSS THE 10 COUNTRIES CONSIDERED IN THIS ARTICLE, THE MEAN PRIVATE SCHOOL EFFECT IS APPROXIMATELY ZERO, RANGING BETWEEN -0.2 AND 0.2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS.

THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OF JUSTO SIERRA UNIVERSITY ESTABLISHED THE OBJECTIVE OF IDENTIFYING THE TERMINAL EFFICIENCY INDEX OF THE SURGEON PROGRAM. A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF EXPLORATORY TYPE WAS CARRIED OUT, WHICH INCLUDED 2,447 RECORDS OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THIRTY-TWO CLASSES AND CALCULATED THE ISOQUANT FRONTIER THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF A TERMINAL EFFICIENCY AND DEGREE COEFFICIENT. THE REAL TERMINAL EFFICIENCY COEFFICIENT THAT RESULTED GLOBALLY WAS .30 (R = 0.004) AND THE GLOBAL DEGREE EFFICIENCY COEFFICIENT WAS .84 (R = 0.95); THESE VALUES SEEK FOR A 1:1 COMPARISON.

BACKGROUND: THE PAPER IS BASED ON THE OPTIMAL TAX THEORY, AND ON PUBLIC EFFICIENCY PRINCIPLE. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK EXPLAINS THAT THE TAX REVENUE IS CONSIDERED FAIR WHEN IT IS DIRECTED TO GUARANTEE THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE WELL-BEING, WITH THE LOWER COST TO THE SOCIETY. THIS WAY, THE STUDY CLASSIFIES AS EFFICIENT, COUNTRIES WHICH APPLY MINIMUM TAX RESOURCES TO REACH HIGH LEVELS OF EDUCATION. METHODS: THIS RESEARCH IS DESCRIPTIVE, DOCUMENTARY AND ADOPTS A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH, USING THE NON-PARAMETRIC DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS [DEA] TECHNIQUE (THE CHARNES, COOPER AND RHODES [CCR] MODEL) AND THE HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER METHOD. RESULTS: THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT LATVIA, SOUTH KOREA, MEXICO, CHILE, ESTONIA, IRELAND, ICELAND, THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA AND SWITZERLAND WERE THE COUNTRIES THAT ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY IN ALLOCATING TAX REVENUES FOR EDUCATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, ITALY, FRANCE, DENMARK, SWEDEN, BRAZIL, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, TURKEY, GERMANY AND NORWAY EXPRESSED LOWER LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY. ADDITIONALLY, THE SURVEY SHOWED THAT COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER TAX REVENUES ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST EFFICIENT IN APPLYING THESE RESOURCES TO EDUCATION.

LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, ARGENTINA LACKS VALID AND RELIABLE DATA WHICH ALLOW THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFICIENCY AT THIS EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AS WELL AS RESEARCH WORKS AIMING TO DO IT. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE REFLECT ABOUT THE RESULTS OF A 'HANDCRAFTED' REPORT THAT WE HAVE DONE ON THE BASIS OF INDIVIDUAL FILES OF 18 DOCTORATE PROGRAMMES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES PLACED IN THE CENTRE AND THE METROPOLITAN AREA OF BUENOS AIRES, BOTH IN 'SOFT' SCIENCES (7) AND 'HARD' SCIENCES (11 PROGRAMMES) WITHIN 2012-2014. HERE WE PRESENT 'EFFICIENCY' MEASURES OF EACH OF THE 18 PROGRAMMES FOR THE SAME DATES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TWO MAIN DIMENSIONS: GRADUATION RATE IN THE REGULATION TIME AND GRADUATION RATE IN 'REAL' AND 'AVERAGE TIME GRADUATION' PER COHORT AND PER ACADEMIC UNIT. WE FOUND GRADUATION RATE IN THE CASE OF 'HARD' SCIENCES, FROM 45% TO 100%, MOST OF THE PROGRAMMES WERE ABOVE THE 70%; AND IN THE CASE OF 'SOFT' SCIENCES, FROM 9% TO 57%, MOST OF THEM BELOW 44%. IN THE CASE OF 'HARD SCIENCES', A COHORT AVERAGE TIME UP TO GRADUATION RESULTED CONSISTENTLY LESS THAN A COHORT AVERAGE TIME UP TO GRADUATION, IN THE CASE OF 'SOFT' SCIENCES, AND CLOSER TO THE REGULATION TIME ESTABLISHED BY THE PROGRAMMES. THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH GIVE RISE TO A SERIES OF REFLECTIONS ABOUT INSTITUTIONAL, ORGANIZATIONAL AND PERSONAL FACTORS THAT MAY EXPLAIN THESE PROBLEMS IN THE PERFORMANCE AMONG STUDENTS, ENABLE DROPOUT MONITORING AT THE DOCTORATE LEVEL AND DESIGN STRATEGIES TO REDUCE IT.\",\n",

AS IT HAS BEEN ARGUED IN THE LITERATURE, UNIVERSITIES IN CHILE ARE FAR FROM BEING CONSIDERED RESEARCH-ORIENTED INSTITUTIONS. CURRENT GOVERNMENTAL REFORMS HAVE PUT PRESSURES ON THE EFFICIENT USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY, PUBLIC EXPENDITURES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IN RESPONSE, THE PROPOSED DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH CAN BE USED TO INFORM EDUCATIONAL MANAGERS AND POLICY MAKERS ABOUT RESEARCH EFFICIENCY. THEREFORE, A BETTER ALLOCATION OF THE SCARCE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES CAN BE ACHIEVED. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS IS USED TO ASSESS THE RESEARCH EFFICIENCY OF A SET OF CHILEAN UNIVERSITIES. FOUR MODELS ARE PROPOSED BASED ON DIFFERENT PARAMETERS TO COVER VARIOUS DRIVERS OF THE RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY. FINDINGS - THE PAPER PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT ONLY A FEW UNIVERSITIES IN CHILE ARE EFFICIENT IN REGARDS TO RESEARCH. MOREOVER, INTERESTING RESULTS IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENCES IN EFFICIENCY BETWEEN TRADITIONAL UNIVERSITIES AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES WERE FOUND. UNIVERSITIES WITH A MIXED-FUNDING STRUCTURE (PRIVATE TRADITIONAL) ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN BOTH PUBLIC AND PURELY PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. ADDITIONALLY, UNIVERSITIES THAT RECEIVE DIRECT FUNDS FROM THE GOVERNMENT ARE ON AVERAGE 3.3 TIMES MORE EFFICIENT THAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. ACCORDING TO THE MODELS, ONLY ONE PRIVATE UNIVERSITY APPEARED AT THE TOP 10 BASED ON THE RESEARCH EFFICIENCY RANKING. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - CURRENT PRESSURES IN THE FUNDING STRUCTURES OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM HAVE LED TO AN INCREASED AWARENESS IN THE UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES. THE RESULTS PROVIDED IN THIS STUDY ARE USEFUL FOR GUIDING A BETTER ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES AND PROVIDING INSIGHTS ABOUT EFFICIENT FUNDING STRUCTURES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF RESEARCH EFFICIENCY AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BEST PERFORMERS ALLOWS EDUCATIONAL MANAGERS TO IMPROVE THEIR RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROCESSES.',\n",

SINCE THE EARLY 1980S, SEVERAL EDUCATIONAL REFORMS HAVE BEEN PASSED WITH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY, EQUITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE CHILEAN EDUCATION SYSTEM. THIS HAS INITIATED A DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFICIENT USE OF PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. IN RESPONSE, THIS STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO IDENTIFYING THE MOST EFFICIENT TYPES OF SCHOOLS BASED ON A SET OF DIFFERENT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY USED DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA), WHICH ESTIMATES A SINGLE INDEX OF EFFICIENCY TO IDENTIFY SCHOOLS PERFORMING AT SUPERIOR LEVELS COMPARED TO OTHER SCHOOLS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. TWO SETS OF MODELS ARE CREATED FOR EVALUATING EFFICIENCY. THE FIRST SET OF ANALYSES PROVIDES A LONGITUDINAL EFFICIENCY COMPARISON BASED ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE ON TWO NATIONAL STANDARDIZED TESTS AS OUTPUTS, AND THE SECOND MODEL INCORPORATES SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDENTS ATTENDING DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AS INPUTS IN THE EFFICIENCY ESTIMATION. FINDINGS - BASED ON THE LONGITUDINAL MODELS, IT WAS FOUND THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE CONSISTENT IN MAINTAINING THEIR EFFICIENCY OVER TIME THAN OTHER TYPES OF SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION, WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED SCHOOLS WERE MORE EFFICIENT THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE CHILEAN PARLIAMENT IS CURRENTLY DISCUSSING NEW EDUCATIONAL REFORMS THAT FOCUS ON MORE EFFICIENT USE OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY AND EQUITY. THE RESULTS PROVIDED IN THIS STUDY GENERATE USEFUL EVIDENCE FOR POLICYMAKERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING SCHOOL EFFICIENCY AND THE APPROPRIATE ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES TO SUPPORT DIVERSE STUDENTS SERVED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - EDUCATION IS A KEY FACTOR AFFECTING SOCIAL MOBILITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETIES. SCHOOLS ARE CALLED UPON TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE TO PROMOTE THESE SOCIAL GOALS. ACCORDINGLY, MORE NOVEL FORMS OF RESEARCH ON EFFICIENCY ARE NECESSARY TO ASSESS HOW WELL SCHOOLS ARE TRANSFORMING THEIR INPUTS INTO PERFORMANCE OUTPUTS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY PROVIDES A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF EDUCATIONAL EFFICIENCY USING DEA WITH A NATIONAL DATA SET OF CHILEAN SCHOOLS TO EVALUATE HOW CONSISTENT THE SCHOOLS ARE IN MAINTAINING THEIR LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY OVER TIME. IN ADDITION, ONE DEA MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR A SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX AT THE STUDENT LEVEL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW EFFICIENTLY SECONDARY SCHOOLS USE THEIR RESOURCES.

TO ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY ON THE EDUCATION EXPENDITURE IT WAS USED THE DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) AND THE INPUTS USED WERE THE VARIABLES EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION, NUMBER OF ENROLLED STUDENTS AND NUMBER OF TEACHERS (INPUT). AS FOR THE PRODUCT IT WAS CONSIDERED THE INDEX OF BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT (IDEB) OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE YEARS 2009 AND 2011. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH SHOW THAT IN THE YEAR 2009 SEVEN SCHOOLS (58.34%) WERE CONSIDERED EFFICIENT AND IN THE YEAR 2011 ONLY FOUR UNITS (30%) ACCORDING TO THE DEA - BCC MODEL. WHEN ANALYZED THROUGH THE CCR MODEL, 5 SCHOOLS (41.67%) HAVE SHOWN EFFECTIVE ONCE IN 2011 ONLY THREE SCHOOLS DID (25%). THE RESEARCH HELPED TO PROVIDE EXPENSES SUPERVISORS WITH A TOOL CAPABLE OF HELPING IN THE MANAGEMENT EVALUATION AND ALLOWING THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS BY MANAGERS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE USEFULNESS OF RESOURCES AND TO PROVIDE A BETTER EFFICIENCY IN THE ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. IT CAN BE NOTICED THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT PRESENTED BIGGER RESOURCE ALLOCATION DID NOT NECESSARILY PRESENTED THEMSELVES AS EFFICIENT, WHICH INDICATED THE NEED OF A BETTER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BY THE MANAGERS IN CHARGE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS.

WE REPORT ON DATA COLLECTED IN SEVEN VILLAGES IN RURAL GUATEMALA ON OVER 2000 CHILDREN. MEASURES OF SCHOOL EFFICIENCY IN THESE VILLAGES INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN ARE ENROLLING IN SCHOOL, PROMOTION, REPETITION, AND DROP-OUT RATES CONTINUE TO BE HIGH AND THAT GIRLS ARE AT A GREATER DISADVANTAGE THAN BOYS IN THIS POPULATION. COMPLEX INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE SCHOOLING VARIABLES POINT TO THE NEED FOR POLICY DECISIONS TO INCORPORATE FAMILY, COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL LEVEL INPUTS.',\n",

IN THIS STUDY, WE FOCUS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF P-HEI IN THREE ACTIVITIES: TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND KNOWLEDGE DISSEMINATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS END, WE DEVELOP A DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS MODEL TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF EACH ACTIVITY, SEPARATELY. USING AN OFFICIAL DATABASE CALLED EXECUM, WE COMPUTE THE EFFICIENCY OF 40 MEXICAN P-HEI FROM YEAR 2008-2016. THE FUNDS ALLOCATED FOR THE GOVERNMENT ARE AN INPUT IN OUR STUDY. ACCORDING TO OUR RESULTS, MOST P-HEIS ARE EFFICIENT IN ONLY ONE ACTIVITY, WHILE FEW ARE EFFICIENT IN TWO ACTIVITIES. ONLY ONE P-HEI REACHED EFFICIENCY OF 100% IN THE THREE MODELS. ON THE OTHER HAND, 37.5% OF THE P-HEI DO NOT REACH 100% EFFICIENCY IN ANY MODEL.
